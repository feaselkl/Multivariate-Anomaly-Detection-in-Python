					<h3>Outliers and Anomalies</h3>

					<p>In the academic literature, there is some ambiguity in the definitions of <strong>outliers</strong> and <strong>anomalies</strong>.  Some authors mean them to be the same and other authors differentiate the two terms.  I will follow the latter practice.</p>

					<p>An <strong>outlier</strong> is something sufficiently different from the norm that we notice it.</p>

					<p>An <strong>anomaly</strong> is an outlier of interest to humans.</p>
					
					<p>Let's dive further into general concepts and technical definitions.</p>

					<h3>General Concepts</h3>
					
					<div class="container">
						<div class="col">
							<p>The non-technical definition of an anomaly is essentially “I’ll know it when I see it.”  This can get muddled at the edges, but works really well because humans are great at pattern matching and picking out things which look dissimilar.</p>

					<p>Univariate = One variable</p>
					
					<p>We have a thing whose behavior we want to understand and the only thing we have available is a stream of data points.  This stream may or may not be part of a time series--if so, that is known as <strong>univariate time series analysis</strong>.</p>

					<h3>Univariate Techniques</h3>

					<p>A variety of techniques are available for univariate outlier detection.  Most of these techniques incorporate an analysis of the <strong>distribution</strong> of the data:  how frequently we see certain values, as well as how close a given value is to others.</p>

					<h3>Multivariate Outlier Detection</h3>

					<p>Fundamentally, multivariate outlier detection is an extension of univariate outlier detection.  We still want to find points which are different from the norm.</p>
					
					<p>A key difference is that distributions tend to be much more complex as different variables correlate to one another.</p>

					<h3>Non-Numeric Inputs</h3>

					<p>Univariate outlier detection almost always focuses around numeric data.  With multivariate outlier detection, we still emphasize numeric variables but might also have non-numeric variables.  The problem is that all of our techniques expect numeric inputs, not strings or other non-numeric types.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/robot.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Non-Numeric Inputs</h3>
					
					<p>There are a few ways to deal with this problem:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Ordinal encoding</li>
						<li>One-hot encoding</li>
						<li>"Bag of words" or word2vec word translation</li>
						<li>Semantic models to transform words and phrases to numeric values</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>For simplicity, we'll send in numeric data only.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/cluster.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>From Distributions to Clusters</h3>

					<p>Typically, however, we don't expect such close correlation in variables and instead want to analyze clusters of data.</p>
					
					<p>Intuitively, outliers are points which are sufficiently "far" from other points (or the majority of points)--if there were a lot of points clustered closely together, they'd be inliers!</p>
					
					<p>In practice, we have techniques which help us formalize this intuition.</p>

					<h3>The Problem with Local Outlier Factor</h3>

					<h3>COF</h3>
					
					<p>Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor (COF) is an attempt to deal with the relative density problems in LOF.</p>
					
					<p>To do so, it adds <strong>isolativity</strong> in addition to density, where isolativity is the degree to which an object is connected to other objects.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Calculating Isolativity</h3>
					
					<p>First, build a chain of length k, linking the current chain to to the next-nearest neighbor.  Here, k = 6, covering a total of 7 nodes.</p>

					<h3>Calculating Isolativity</h3>
					
					<img src="presentation/assets/image/COF%20Outlier.png" height="325" />
					
					<p>Then, perform a weighted calculation which emphasizes the lower-numbered links more than the higher-numbered links.  This gives us the COF value.  Points with higher COF values are more likely to be outliers.</p>

					<h3>The Problem with COF</h3>
					
					<p>COF is definitely better than LOF and is a useful part of an ensemble.  The problem is that COF does not provide specific guidance on what is an outlier.</p>
					
					<p>The closest we have is an ordered list (letting us choose the top X% by score) and the ability to create our own cutoff.</p>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/city-at-night.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Won't You Be My Neighbor?</h3>
					
					<p>LOCI does not ask for k nearest neighbors.  It instead asks for a <strong>neighborhood size</strong> <code>alpha</code>, representing a max distance between neighbors for our calculation.</p>

					<h3>Doing the Math</h3>

					<p>For <code>p2</code>, that is <code>1 - (3 / 3) = 0</code>.</p>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/checklist.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Doing the Math</h3>
					
					<p>This gets us to our final parameter:  <code>k</code>, representing the number of standard deviations from MDEF before we declare an outlier.  By convention, this is 3.</p>

					<h3>Copulas!</h3>
					
					<p>We transform a joint probability distribution into several <strong>marginal distributions</strong> (aka <strong>marginals</strong>).  These marginals are all independent and therefore not correlated with other variables.</p>
					
					<p>A <strong>copula</strong> is a function which transforms a single joint distribution to multiple marginal distributions.</p>

					<h3>Implementing COPOD:  PyOD</h3>
					
					<p>The <code>PyOD</code> library also has an implementation of COPOD we can use.</p>
					
					<p>One important consideration here is that the scale of COPOD differs significantly from COF and LOCI.  Furthermore, it changes based on the median of the dataset.</p>

					<h3>From Outlier to Anomaly</h3>
					
					<p>The last step in the process is for a human to understand whether any given outlier is actually an anomaly and act upon it.  We have built an outlier detection engine but people turn it into an anomaly detector.</p>
					
					<p>As a bonus, if you allow people to mark outliers as anomalous or not, you can use that data to train a future model, possibly one which is considerably better than what a general-purpose outlier detection engine will give you.</p>
